.SH DESCRIPTION
.B html2text
reads HTML documents from the
.IR input-file s,
formats each of them into a stream of UTF-8 encoded characters,
and writes the result to standard output (or into
.IR output-file ,
if the
.B -o
command line option is used).
.P
If no
.IR input-file s
are specified on the command line,
.B html2text
reads from standard input. A dash as the
.I input-file
is an alternate way to specify standard input.
.P
.B html2text
understands all HTML 3.2 constructs, but can render only part of them due to
the limitations of the text output format. However, the program attempts to
provide good substitutes for the elements it cannot render.
.B html2text
parses HTML 4 input, too, but not always as successful as other HTML
processors. It also accepts syntactically incorrect input, and attempts to
interpret it "reasonably".
.P
The way
.B html2text
formats the HTML documents is controlled by formatting properties read
from an RC file.
.B html2text
attempts to read
.I $HOME/.html2textrc
(or the file specified by the
.B -rcfile
command line option); if that file cannot be read,
.B html2text
attempts to read
.IR /etc/html2textrc .
If no RC file can be read (or if the RC file does not override all
formatting properties), then "reasonable" defaults are assumed. The
RC file format is described in the
.BR html2textrc (5)
manual page.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-ascii
By default,
.B html2text
uses
.B UTF-8
for its output. Specifying this option, plain
.B ASCII
is used instead. Non\-ASCII characters are rendered via iconv's
transliteration feature.  As such this option is an alias for
.B -to_encoding
.IR ASCII//TRANSLIT .
.TP
.BI "\-from_encoding " encoding
Sets the encoding of the input file or stream to the given encoding.  By
default,
.B html2text
uses ISO-8859-1 encoding for reading.  You probably always want to
override this default using this option.  See 
.B iconv -l
for a list of supported encodings.
.TP
.BI "\-to_encoding " encoding
Use the given encoding while writing output, instead of UTF-8.  The same
set of encodings as for the
.B \-from_encoding
option can be used.
.TP
.B \-check
This option is for diagnostic purposes: The HTML document is only parsed and
not processed otherwise. In this mode of operation,
.B html2text
will report on parse errors and scan errors, which it does not in other modes
of operation. Note that parse and scan errors are not fatal for
.BR html2text ,
but may cause mis-interpretation of the HTML code and/or portions of the
document being swallowed.
.TP
.B \-debug\-parser
Let
.B html2text
report on the tokens being shifted, rules being applied, etc., while scanning
the HTML document. This option is for diagnostic purposes.
.TP
.B \-debug\-scanner
Let
.B html2text
report on each lexical token scanned, while scanning the HTML document. This
option is for diagnostic purposes.
.TP
.B \-help
Print command line summary and exit.
.TP
.B \-nobs
By default,
.B html2text
renders underlined letters with sequences like "underscore-backspace-character"
and boldface letters like "character-backspace-character", which works fine
when the output is piped into
.BR more (1),
.BR less (1),
or similar. For other applications, or when redirecting the output into a file,
it may be desirable not to render character attributes with such backspace
sequences, which can be accomplished with this command line option.
.TP
.BI \-o " output\-file"
Write the output to
.I output\-file
instead of standard output. A dash as the
.I output\-file
is an alternate way to specify the standard output.
.TP
.BI \-rcfile " path"
Attempt to read the file specified in
.I path
as RC file.
.TP
.B \-links
Tags all external links with a number between brackets
.RI "([" num "]),"
and produces a numbered list at the end of the document with all link
targets.
.TP
.B \-unparse
This option is for diagnostic purposes: Instead of formatting the parsed document,
generate HTML code, that is guaranteed to be syntactically correct. If
.B html2text
has problems parsing a syntactically incorrect HTML document, this option
may help you to understand what
.B html2text
thinks that the original HTML code means.
.TP
.B \-version
Print program version and exit.
.TP
.BI \-width " width"
By default,
.B html2text
formats the HTML documents for a screen width of 79 characters. If redirecting
the output into a file, or if your terminal has a width other than 80
characters, or if you just want to get an idea how
.B html2text
deals with large tables and different terminal widths, you may want to specify
a different
.IR width .
.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/html2textrc
System wide parser configuration file.
.TP
.I $HOME/.html2textrc
Personal parser configuration file, overrides the system wide values.
